CloudTrail: Multi-region trails disabled, or Log File Validation disabled (allowing undetected log tampering).

CloudWatch: Log Groups lacking retention periods, causing infinite compounding log storage costs.

## G:3 — CloudWatch: Missing critical anomaly Alarms for SQS DLQ depth (ApproximateNumberOfMessag…

CloudWatch: Missing critical anomaly Alarms for SQS DLQ depth (ApproximateNumberOfMessagesVisible) or 5xx API errors.

## G:4 — AWS Organizations: Missing Service Control Policies (SCPs) to Prevent Resource Modificat…

AWS Organizations: Missing Service Control Policies (SCPs) to Prevent Resource Modification. Failing to restrict root member account activities at the organization level, allowing developers to accidentally delete centralized security instrumentation or disable logging trails.

## G:5 — CloudWatch: Missing Metric Filters for Mass-Extraction Detection

CloudWatch: Missing Metric Filters for Mass-Extraction Detection. Absence of pattern matching alarms for sensitive text phrases (e.g., AccessDenied, Password, BearerToken) in application stdout logs, meaning configuration leaks remain undetected until exploited.

## G:6 — CloudTrail: Failing to Log S3 Data Events for Sensitive Asset Pools

CloudTrail: Failing to Log S3 Data Events for Sensitive Asset Pools. Omitting granular data-plane logging for highly confidential cloud storage objects, creating a blind spot regarding exactly who accessed or extracted user data files.

## G:7 — CloudWatch: Alarms without actions, or actions routed to dead/unsubscribed SNS topics —…

CloudWatch: Alarms without actions, or actions routed to dead/unsubscribed SNS topics — alerts firing into the void.

## G:8 — CloudWatch: No composite alarms — a single incident pages 40 times across correlated sym…

CloudWatch: No composite alarms — a single incident pages 40 times across correlated symptoms.

## G:9 — Logging: Unstructured printf/console logging in production instead of structured JSON wi…

Logging: Unstructured printf/console logging in production instead of structured JSON with stable field shapes.

## G:10 — Logging: Correlation/request IDs not propagated across service hops — cross-service trac…

Logging: Correlation/request IDs not propagated across service hops — cross-service traces unjoinable.

## G:11 — AWS Config: Recording disabled — no resource-drift history or compliance snapshots avail…

AWS Config: Recording disabled — no resource-drift history or compliance snapshots available for the auditor.

## G:12 — Tagging: Cost-allocation and ownership tags unenforced — orphan resources nobody can att…

Tagging: Cost-allocation and ownership tags unenforced — orphan resources nobody can attribute or safely delete.

## G:13 — Tracing: No distributed tracing across async hops (Lambda→SQS→Lambda), making end-to-end…

Tracing: No distributed tracing across async hops (Lambda→SQS→Lambda), making end-to-end latency invisible.

Dashboards: No single per-workload health dashboard; incident response starts with ad-hoc metric spelunking.

Budgets: No AWS Budgets or Cost Anomaly Detection alerts — runaway spend discovered on the monthly invoice.

CloudWatch: High-cardinality custom metric dimensions (per-user/per-request) exploding metric ingestion costs.

SSM: Session Manager sessions without session logging to encrypted S3/CloudWatch — privileged access leaves no trail.
